Overview: The Code Generator is a powerful tool designed to streamline the development process of C# projects in the .NET framework. It automates the generation of the Data Access Layer (DAL) and Business Layer, simplifying database interactions and common operations.

Key Features:

Data Access Layer (DAL):

Automatically generates code to connect to the database.
Provides methods for retrieving, updating, and deleting data.
Enhances database communication, making it efficient and secure.
Business Layer:

Simplifies common operations with pre-built functions.
Operations include adding, deleting, updating, checking existence, retrieving by ID, and fetching all records.
Promotes code consistency and accelerates project development.

Why Use Code Generator?

Efficiency: Quickly set up database interactions without manual coding.
Consistency: Enforces a standardized structure for DAL and Business Layer.
Productivity: Focus on business logic rather than repetitive CRUD operations.
